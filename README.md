### Author: etorresram
This repository was created to identify, analyze, and explore the digital skills extracted from job postings in Argentina during the period from January to July 2023. The analysis leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to uncover key trends, emerging patterns, and in-demand skills in the local job market.

By utilizing advanced text-processing techniques, this project aims to:

1. Identify the most requested digital skills across various sectors.
2. Analyze differences in job requirements between industries.
3. Provide insights into the evolving nature of the labor market.
   
The data was collected daily from the Google Careers platform and processed using a combination of NLP models, including TF-IDF, and unsupervised clustering techniques. 
Ultimately, the goal is to offer a comprehensive overview of digital skill demands in Argentina's job market during the specified period.
